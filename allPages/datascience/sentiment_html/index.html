                <h1>Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Heuristics</h1>
            </div>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
            In this assignment, I used the Twitter API in Python to conduct an analysis of tweets. I collected over 40,000 tweet objects from ten minutes of streaming. A tweet object consisted of many data fields including the tweet text, the user, and the time of the tweet. I used a Twitter Developer account and OAuth authorization to fetch these tweets. I then parsed this data and conducted analyses based on the words in the tweet, the username, and the location.
            </p>
            <h2>Searching tweets</h2>
            <p> To begin with, I used the Twitter API to search through texts for a certain term. I chose the term "dance" and was able to retrieve tweets with this term by sending a GET request to the Twitter server and passing in the parameter of the term, dance. Below are a few examples of what this returned. </p>
            <pre><code>"Happiness is not the absence of challenges. It's learning to dance through them." 
"Practising a dance routine at playtime and feeling like you were going to be in the next Girls Aloud" 
"When I had the chance  Take you to every party  Cause all you wanted to do was dance  Now my baby is dancing" 
"TELEPHONE.@RockaBam:Stop calling stop calling,I don't wanna think anymore.I left my head and my heart on the dance floor... </code> </pre>
            <h2> Most frequent words</h2>
            <p> I analyzed my collection of tweets to find the most frequent words. I counted the number of times a word occurred and divided it by the total number of words I was analyzing. I excluded a list of "stop words" such as "I", "the", and "who" from this analysis. I only analyzed English tweets (which I could determine by accessing the language field of the tweet object that I retrieved). In order to parse my tweet texts, I stripped all punctuation and converted each word to lower case. I decided on this so that "mountain" and "mountain." would not be considered separate words. In the analyses described below, I employed a similar parsing strategy. I found that stripping punctuation entirely worked better than converting punctuation to space, which led to awkward left-overs such as "nt" from contractions. Below, I've reported the 30 most frequent words and their frequency. Unsurprisingly, "rt," short for retweet, was at the top of the list. </p>

            <h2> Happiest and saddest tweets</h2>
            <p> I also conducted a sentiment analysis on the tweets using the AFINN-111 standard, which assigns a sentiment value to a large dictionary of words. Any words not in this dictionary were given a score of zero. I ranked my tweets from happiest to saddest (again by parsing the text from the tweet object and only using English tweets with words stripped of punctuation and converted to lower case). Below the score along with the tweet for my ten most highest and lowest sentiment scores are ranked. </p>

            <h2> Breaking Bad actors</h2>
            <p> For my analyis of Breaking Bad actors, I sent a GET request to Twitter sending in the parameter of the actor's Twitter username and specified that I wanted their latest 100 tweets (some have fewer than 100). I then stored this information in a csv file and parsed it to get information for their sentiments. Using the method described for sentiment analysis, I found the average sentiment of a tweet for each actor. Below, I have reported their average sentiment score and the username. </p>

            <h2> Happiest and Saddest States</h2>
            <p> I analyzed each of the states to find which were the "happiest" and the "saddest." The same analyis of sentiments was used. In order to retrieve the state abbreviation, I used the place data structure in the tweet object. I first checked that the country was the US, and then I parsed the full name of the place by splitting on the comma and taking the second element. The full name is reported in the form  "city, abbreviation" such as "Dallas, TX." I then found the average tweet sentiment for each state. Since most tweets don't have a location associated with them, I was only able to retrieve information on 41 of the states from the ten minutes of data that I had collected. Below I've reported the happiest and saddest states with their sentiment scores. </p>
