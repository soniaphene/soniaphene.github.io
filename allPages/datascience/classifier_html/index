					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p> I'm studying Computer Science-Applied Math at Brown University. </p>
					<h3> Education </h3>
					<p> I am currently studying at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. I will graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science-Applied Math in 2015. </p>
					<p> I graduated as Valedictorian from Washington-Lee in 2011. I also attended Rowland Hall-St. Marks school in Salt Lake City, Utah from 2007-2008.</p>
					<h3> Growing Up</h3>
					<p> I moved around a lot growing up, and I've lived in 16 different places! I spent most of my childhood in Texas, was in Utah for a while, and have been based out of Washington, D.C. for the past five years. I'm currently studying (and surviving the cold New England winters) in Providence, RI. </p>
					<h3> Other Fun Stuff</h3>
					<p> I enjoy coding, robotics, zumba, dancing and writing. I also love reading a good book, so I'd love to hear if you have any suggestions.</p>
